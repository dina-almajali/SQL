Chinook Database

In this lab, you will query the Chinook Database. 
The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 
For this lab, you will be answering queries to help the Chinook team understand the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 



Q1 The Chinook database contains all invoices from the beginning of 2009 till the end of 2013.
The employees at Chinook store are interested in seeing all invoices that happened in 2013 only. Using the Invoice table, 
write a query that returns all the info of the invoices in 2013.


SELECT *
FROM invoice
WHERE invoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2014-01-01'

Q2 The Chinook team decided to run a marketing campaign in Brazil, Canada, india, and Sweden. 
Using the customer table, write a query that returns the first name, last name, and country for all customers from the 4 countries.


SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM customer
WHERE Country IN ('Brazil','Canada','India','Sweden')


Q3 Using the Track and Album tables, write a query that returns all the songs that start with the letter 'A' and the composer field is not empty. 
Your query should return the name of the song, the name of the composer, and the title of the album.


SELECT track.name, track.composer, album.title 
FROM track 
JOIN album
ON track.albumid = album.Albumid
WHERE track.name LIKE 'A%' AND track.composer IS NOT Null;


Q4 The Chinook team would like to throw a promotional Music Festival for their top 10 customers who have spent the most in a single invoice.
Write a query that returns the first name, last name, and invoice total for the top 10 invoices ordered by invoice total descending."


SELECT customer.firstname, customer.lastname,invoice.total 
FROM customer
JOIN Invoice
ON Invoice.customerid = customer.customerid
ORDER BY invoice.total DESC
LIMIT 10

Q5 Use the Invoice table to determine the countries that have the most invoices. 
Provide a table of BillingCountry and Invoices ordered by the number of invoices for each country.
The country with the most invoices should appear first.


SELECT BillingCountry, COUNT(*)
FROM invoice
Group By BillingCountry
ORDER BY 2 DESC

Q6 We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. 
Write a query that returns the 1 city that has the highest sum of invoice totals.
Return both the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.
**check your solution**The top city for Invoice dollars was Prague with an amount of 90.24


SELECT billingCity, SUM(total)
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billingCity
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1

Q7  The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer.
Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.
I found the solution by linking the following three: Invoice, InvoiceLine, and Customer tables to retrieve this information, but you can probably do it with fewer!
** check your solution **The customer who spent the most according to invoices was Customer 6 with 49.62 in purchases.

SELECT c.customerId,c.firstName,c.lastName,SUM(l.unitPrice)
FROM Invoice i
JOIN Customer c
ON i.customerId=c.customerId
JOIN invoiceLine l
ON l.invoiceId=i.invoiceId
GROUP By 1,2,3
ORDER BY SUM(l.unitPrice) DESC
LIMIT 1

Q8 The team at Chinook would like to identify all the customers who listen to Rock music.
Write a query to return the email, first name, last name, and Genre of all Rock Music listeners. 
Return your list ordered alphabetically by email address starting with 'A'.
Check your solutionYour final table should have 59 rows and 4 columns.


Select C.Email,C.FirstName,C.LastName,G.Name
From Customer C
Join Invoice I
On C.CustomerId= I.CustomerId
Join InvoiceLine Inv
On I.InvoiceId= Inv.InvoiceId
Join Track T
On T.TrackId = Inv.TrackId
Join Genre G
On G.GenreId = T.GenreId
where G.Name = 'Rock'
group by Email


Q9 Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.
You should only need to use the Customer and Invoice tables.
Check Your Solution
Though there are only 24 countries, your query should return 25 rows because the United Kingdom has 2 customers that share the maximum

with c as(select Invoice.CustomerId as id_cst, Invoice.BillingCountry as Country, sum(Invoice.Total) as som from Invoice
join Customer on Invoice.BillingCountry = Customer.Country and Invoice.CustomerId = Customer.CustomerId

select customers.cust_id, customers.name_customer,customers.lastname_customer, b.country, b.max_som from Customers,
(select a.country as country, max(a.som) as max_som from
(select Invoice.CustomerId as id_cst, Invoice.BillingCountry as Country, sum(Invoice.Total) as som from Invoice join Customer on Invoice.BillingCountry = Customer.Country and Invoice.CustomerId = Customer.CustomerId
